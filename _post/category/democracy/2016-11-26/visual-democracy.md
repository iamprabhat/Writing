<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p align="justify">People from around the world have identified the basic principles, which must exist in order to have a democratic government. These principles often become a part of the constitution or bill of rights in a democratic society. Though no two democratic countries are exactly alike, people in democracies support many of the same basic principles and desire the same benefits from their government.</p>

It is not only their right, but it is their duty. Citizen participation may take many forms including standing for election, voting in elections, becoming informed about what’s going on for the rights and services, debating issues, attending community or civic meetings, being members of voluntary organizations, paying taxes, and even protesting, if anything is not going in favour of the people. Participation can builds a better democracy that further leads to better governance for all, allowing every benefits of it.</p>

<p align="justify">Democratic societies emphasize the principle that all people are equal. Equality means that all individuals are valued equally, have equal opportunities, and may not be discriminated against because of their race, religion, ethnic group, gender or sexual orientation. In a democracy, individuals and groups still maintain their right to have different cultures, personalities, languages and beliefs.</p>
