<i>“We can control our lives by controlling our perceptions.” — Bruce Lipton.</i>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p align="justify">Literally, <i>Democracy</i> is a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.</p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p align="justify">People from around the world have identified the basic principles, which must exist in order to have a democratic government. These principles often become a part of the constitution or bill of rights in a democratic society. Though no two democratic countries are exactly alike, people in democracies support many of the same basic principles and desire the same benefits from their government.</p>
<h3>1. Citizens Participations:</h3>
<p align="justify">One of the most basic signposts of a democracy is citizen participation in government. Participation is the key role of citizens in democracy. It is not only their right, but it is their duty. Citizen participation may take many forms including standing for election, voting in elections, becoming informed about what’s going on for the rights and services, debating issues, attending community or civic meetings, being members of voluntary organizations, paying taxes, and even protesting, if anything is not going in favour of the people. Participation can builds a better democracy that further leads to better governance for all, allowing every benefits of it.</p>
<h3>2. Equality:</h3>
<p align="justify">Democratic societies emphasize the principle that all people are equal. Equality means that all individuals are valued equally, have equal opportunities, and may not be discriminated against because of their race, religion, ethnic group, gender or sexual orientation. In a democracy, individuals and groups still maintain their right to have different cultures, personalities, languages and beliefs.</p>
<h3>3. Accountability:</h3>
<p align="justify">In a democracy, elected and appointed officials have to be accountable to the people. They are responsible for their actions. Officials and ministers must make decisions and perform their duties according to the will and wishes of the people, not for themselves. <i>If anything is going on inverse, we can say it’s a personalised democracy or one way democracy</i>.</p>
<h3>4. Transparency:</h3>
<p align="justify"><i>For government to be accountable the people must be aware of what is happening in the country. This is referred to as <b>transparency in governance</b> by elected government</i>. A transparent government holds public meetings and allows citizens to attend. In a democracy, the press and the people are able to get information about what decisions are being made, by whom and why; also what will be the consequences of it.</p>
